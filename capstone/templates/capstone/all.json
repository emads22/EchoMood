I love how it extrapolated down there! 0:58 there's some leak hiss going on at 0:58. I'll call that \"artistic license\". 1:08 it goes quite a bit above the standard range for a tenor sax, but those notes should be available in altissimo with some fancy fingerings. 2:20 you can almost taste the spit! 2:58 it plays the same note back to back, but changes the tone of the note. Very cool.  This ToneTransfer AI Sax is amazing. Getting this level of detail in a recording with standard virtual instruments is almost impossible. AI for the win!",

I remember these from 5th-grade music class along with flute-o-phones and recorders. What I didn't know back then, is that you can pick individual strings too! You don't have to just strum! This piece is 100% picking. A manual autoharp. Hey Mrs. Withersby, stick that in your flute-o-phone and pluck it!",

So we have to give all the notes to one person so it doesn't sound like harp hell. But now you need to rest, because plucking like that is insane, so the other person gets the next tough part.  You also need to make sure that each part makes sense so you can practice it and not feel like you're throwing your soul down a well.  I believe this is the best arrangement of this piece for 2 harps; A thing which should never have been tried. The arrangement itself is in the Public Domain, and sheet music is available.",

There is also food and drinks with those little umbrellas... Other than that - not much. Except snorkeling. Snorkeling is pretty cool. Oh, there is also Art Night on Tuesday - where you get a volleyball and some paints and make yourself a friend! Beach chess... I forgot about Beach Chess. Don't play white against Todd, though - he plays all-Hedgehog all the time. Come on, Todd - just once, seriously ONCE could you play King's Indian or... you know what? I'd even take the French Defence; Exchange Variation, you boring symmetrical jerk.",

When you go out playing an instrument in a band for money, that is called \"gigging\". Gigging is good for a trombone player... but man, you gotta be good. You pretty much need a bass player and a drummer... not many people need a trombone player, so they typically don't get many gigs... Did I explain that right? Wait, let me start over... ",

It is a little village of 8 million people that I've somehow never heard of. Oh sure, I've heard the name, but I don't associate it with anything specific. Chicago: Hot Dogs. Amsterdam: Offensively tall Dutch. Moscow: \"Stop a Douchebag\". Shenyang: No clue. How did I miss this city?? You already know if you need this piece, it has a more satisfying low-end than actual real Chinese music, and it should fit in with your modern productions well.",

I guess they have the ones that are mounted on big trucks - and those trucks share a lot in common with cars, you know steering wheels, engines, tires, and the soon-to-be-anachronistic internal combustion engine. Anyway, if you don't like the bass you can pretty easily EQ it to a reasonable level, or buy the stems and remix it yourownself. Before you complain about the use of the word \"yourownself\", I wrote it. You understood it. It is a word. There is also some dreamy flute in here.",

My newest piece studies, experiences and isomorphically dominates a variety of structured tension-hemiolas. In short, the method must never present the sound-world. I never examine continuities, despite the fact that any gesture or non-linearity can be, and has been interpreted as a rather orchestrally-monophonic set of 'canon-aerophones'. In my most recent work, vibrations, materials and rhythmic oscillations are all used within chaotically-transdisciplinary gestures, allowing the audience to improvise a variety of symbolic idioms. I am very much influenced by the idea of dismissing popular solos, particularly whilst combined with a highly polyrhythmic approach to spaces. Download comes in one faster and one slower tempo.

The pizzicato strings provide the rhythm in the first half, while strings and horns play the melody. A harp accompanies a celeste in creating transitions between segments of the music. As the music crescendos into the third minute, the frivolity turns more serious, and the piece ends with a few interchangeable chords between the celeste and the horns.<BR>",

At 0:33 the strings crescendo to follow the melody of the koto, but at 1:18 the tempo slows and the strings fade away, only to return to highlight the final chord.  With the even rhythm and the sharply accentuated plucks of the koto, this is best used as an introduction to a short film or game, or the resolution to a conflict surrounding family or challenges to tradition.",

It is very easy to record (Pizzicato strings have been one of the few samples that have sounded \"real\" for a long time).    3. The composer is long dead and his stuff is in the Public Domain (L\u00e9o Delibes; 1891). And for some background... Sylvia is a 3-Act ballet first produced in 1876. I'm pretty certain this particular piece has nothing to do with the plot - or it wouldn't be called a \"divertissement\".",

The percussive beat begins again at 2:18, and then the frenzied, reverbed staccato of the piano enters, accompanied by a swelling synth lead. At 3:40 the piece finds it?s stride with pulsating synthesizer effects and a rumbling bass line. Best used as accompaniment for a tense, difficult level of a game or as the final battle with a villain. Because of its steady bass beat and snyth effects, this could also work well to depict a tense and suspenseful race to the finish, or as the music playing during a vibrant, pounding rave. ",
